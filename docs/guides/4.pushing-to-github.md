## Push Your Changes to Your Fork

You can "push" changes to your forked repository by using Git Bash, or GitHub Desktop.

Using Git Bash:

```console
git push origin <branch>
```

Or using GitHub Desktop:

```md
Click the button that says: "Push origin"
```

If you created a new branch, you can push the local branch to GitHub using:

```console
git push -u origin <branch>
```
