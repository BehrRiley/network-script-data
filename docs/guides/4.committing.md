## Saving Your Changes as "Commits"

To properly log and save the modifications you have made into your forked Git repository, you must commit them using Git.

You can do this with Git Bash by typing:

```console
$ git add .

User@Computer MINGW64 ~/directory/repository (branch)
$ git commit -m "Commit message goes here."

[branch sha-1 short hash] Commit message goes here.
 x files changed, y insertions(+), z deletions(-)
```

Or using GitHub Desktop:

```md
Look to the bottom-left corner of the window.
There will be two text boxes, and a button that reads "Commit to <current branch>".

The first text box requires you to write a summary of your unstaged changes.
The second text box is an optional, larger text field that allows you to further detail the changes made.

Below the text boxes, there is a button that, when clicked, will stages the changes made.
The button can only be pressed once a commit summary has been entered.
```
