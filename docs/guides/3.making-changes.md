## Before You Edit a Denizen Script

In the previous section of this guide, we recommended you install [_Visual Studio Code_](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and get the [_DenizenScript_](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DenizenScript.denizenscript) extension. This is our recommended setup for writing Denizen scripts.

We also recommend you have a test server, for the purpose of testing and debugging scripts. Our network uses the [_Paper_](https://papermc.io/) server software, so we advise you to host a Paper server locally. You can easily do this on your computer. A dedicated server is not required for testing.

Of course, before you start making your changes, you should learn what _DenizenScript_ is, and how to use it. Read the [_Denizen Beginner's Guide_](https://guide.denizenscript.com/) to get started on learning DenizenScript.

## Understanding Our Code

Once you have read the _Denizen Beginner's Guide_, and have forked & cloned [`BehrRiley/network-script-data`](https://github.com/BehrRiley/network-script-data), you must understand our code.

To do this, you should read over the code, line-by-line. If you see something you do not understand, you can search it in the documentation [here](https://one.denizenscript.com/denizen/logs).
