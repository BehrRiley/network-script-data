# Contributing to Adriftus

First and foremost, thanks for taking the time to contribute to our project. Whether it's just reporting a bug or adding something huge for our community, all levels of contribution are appreciated. We wouldn't be where we go without the people. This guide is made to establish good guidelines to follow when contributing, not rules. Feel free to ask questions if you need clarity; no question is a bad question if it's at all helpful to someone. We primarily ask you use your best judgement and common sense when working with us.

## Questions

The projects within our organization and our repository sites are made for productive content.
If you only have general inqueries or questions, we ask that you directly communicate with us on our [Discord](http://discord.adriftus.com).
Issues that do not productively contribute to the project will be closed.

If your question is in regards to our privacy concerns, please make sure to verify you've read our [Privacy Policy](docs/contribution_docs/privacy_policy.md).
Further questions regarding this can be directed to `Behr#5303` on Discord.

## Code of Conduct

For all code implemention, please make sure this is your own work.
In the case that someone has asked you, or you are someone requesting a current active contributor to implement your contribution, we ask that who-ever has created the content to contribute this themselves from their own GitHub account.
We offer oAuth connections and applications available to process handling the repository forks for you to better expedite the grunt-work behind setting up a workplace, however it is not required to fork and create a pull request with your contributions.
As mentioned in the intro, please don't be afraid to ask if not knowing how prevents you from contributing.
We're here to help you help us if that's the case.

In the case that the content being contributed is not yours or references content from another source, we ask and strongly recommend that you credit where credit belongs, just as we request that the person contributing is the one contributing as themselves as referenced in the previous paragraph.
There's no shame in mentioning you found something cool someplace and made the effort to contribute it to our project - so long as we credit both people for the great work.

Content must verifiably be functional, or be evident that it would work.
Testing is the best way to verify that something you've made works.
A good rule of thumb is that if you can provide evidence (eg, a screenshot or a video) of the feature working, you likely won't be questioned whether or not you've tested this.
We ask that you take adequate time to thuroughly verify your content works; Even a single active developer for a scripting language that they primarily coordinate the design and function for will typically cross-reference their documentation and meta for content when working with their own language.

Lastly, while this guide is meant to be guideline for contribution, we strongly request you abide code styles, formatting, and by no means **obfuscate any content**.
